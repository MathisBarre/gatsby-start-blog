## Challenge 1: Create a Gatsby Blog from Scratch

Why share all of your ideas with just Reddit and Twitter? Your best writing needs a home - on your very own blog!

This week, letâ€™s get a Gatsby blog up-and-running from scratch. Youâ€™ll get practice setting up your local environment, creating new pages from React components, sourcing content from Markdown files, and deploying your site to a host!

If you are new to Node.js or React development, a Gatsby blog is a terrific project to start with.

Bonus: use your new blog to track your #100DaysOfGatsby progress! Research shows that writing about what you learn, or even what youâ€™re struggling with helps you to retain that information, or even discover a solution. So, during your #100DaysOfGatsby journey, we encourage you to use this blog to write about your ups and downs, victories and challenges.

## Want more ?

If you are already familiar with Gatsbyâ€™s APIs and conventions, and want a more advanced challenge, you can create a Gatsby theme for your blog.

## ðŸš€ Try it locally !

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up with `gatsby develop` command.

    ```shell
    git clone 
    cd #1-construct-a-blog
    gatsby develop

    ```
